Good web design is the same as good design in general. If you understand what makes something a good design, you'll be able to apply those rules to your websites.

The most important elements in web design are good navigation, concise and effective pages, working links, and, most importantly, good grammar and spelling. Keep these things in mind as you add color and graphics and your website will be off to a great start.
